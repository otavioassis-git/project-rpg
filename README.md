## Motivation
The creation of the Project RPG came from the necessity of our party to have custom maps for our adventures. We got a projector so we could project the maps on a surface but that wasn't enought. So I've build this program where you could hide parts of the map and project them at the DM's will.

## How to use (windows only)
### Just download the latest version, install it and have fun!

It uses electron auto updater, which  means if a new update is ready to install the app will notify you! Don't have to worry about needing to download and install again!

## Features
The app is divided in pages. Here is its features:

- ### Map Hider
The main feature of the app. It's a page where you can upload your map, or paste its URL to it. With the map in hands you can now spawn boxes and hide the places that are not meant to be seen yet. When ready, you can project it to you second monitor or a projector!

- ### Image Finder
Don't worry, if you haven't decided yet on which map to use you can search them on this page. It's a google images page where you can save or copy the maps that you search.

- ### Settings
A menu where you can tweek some features.
