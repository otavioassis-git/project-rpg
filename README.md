## Motivation
The creation of the Project RPG came from the necessity of our party to have custom maps for our adventures. We got a projector so we could project the maps on a surface but that wasn't enought. So I've build this program where you could hide parts of the map and project them at the DM's will.

## How to use (windows only)
### Just download the latest version (Project-RPG-Setup-x.x.x.exe), install it and have fun!

It uses electron auto updater, which  means if a new update is ready to install the app will notify you! Don't have to worry about needing to download and install again!

If you want to use the backend features, follow the steps on https://github.com/otavioassis-git/project-rpg-backend

## Features
The app is divided in pages. Here is its features:

- ### Map Hider
The main feature of the app. It's a page where you can upload your map, paste its URL or use the images uploaded to your account. With the map in hands you can now spawn boxes and hide the places that are not meant to be seen yet. When ready, you can project it to you second monitor or a projector!

The images you use will be saved in a history to be used later.

Or, if you have the backend up and running, you can link them to your account and use them anywhere!

- ### Image Finder
Don't worry, if you haven't decided yet on which map to use you can search them on this page. It's a google images page where you can save or copy the maps that you search.

- ### Comunity images (backend feature)
A new tab to see what images the comunity is using. You can add images from other account to yours.

- ### Settings
A menu where you can tweek some features.
